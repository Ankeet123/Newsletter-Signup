# Newsletter-Signup

Heya!
Here basically for receiving newsletter you are signing up in my website, and it takes the input of your firstname, lastname and email addres. On successful submission the signup page will redirect to a success page else it will show the failure page. 

The most important thing here is that, in contrast to previous small works with APIs, where you run your work in localhost server, here you will be using an actual https url for running your website which you can share with everyone. I achieved this by using heroku. 

And all the data of the people who subscribed to your newsletter will be visible in the Mailchimp audience dashboard section. (Mailchimp is the site whose API I used for this newsletter-signup project).

You must go through the documentations of both heroku and mailchimp for this task...

That's it from my side. 
Thanks :)
